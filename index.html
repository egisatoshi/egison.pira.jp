<h2 id="what">What is Egison?</h2>

<p>
  Egison is the
  <ul>
    <li>pattern-matching-oriented</li>
    <li>purely functional</li>
  </ul>
  programming language.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  A feature of Egison is the strong pattern matching facility.
  With Egison, you can represent pattern matching for data types whose data have no normal forms,
  such as set, multiset, and algebraic structures such as group, ring, field, and so on.
</p>

<!--
<p>
  Egison will include
  <ul>
    <li>concurrent system as Erlang</li>
    <li>static typing system as Haskell and OCaml</li>
  </ul>
  in the next version 4, now developing.
</p>

<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern Matching of Egison</h2>

<p>
  Egison can pattern-match with data types whose data have no canonical forms.
  Such kind of data types is called an <i>unfree data type</i>.
</p>

<p>
  In pattern-matching of well-known programming languages, the existence of canonical forms is assumed.
  Therefore, when we do pattern-matching with unfree data types, we need to translate and regard them as data which have a canonical form.
  For example, a set would be treated as a list.
  Many programmers think this is unavoidable, and in fact, it is a latent stress of programming.
  Sets and multisets often play important roles in expressing algorithms.
  So natural expression for handling these kinds of data is also important.
</p>

<p>
  Egison is the world's first programming language that makes pattern-matching with unfree data types practical.
  Following features enables practical pattern-matching with unfree data types.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Multiple pattern-matching results</dt>
  <dd>
    Pattern-matching has multiple results.
    This feature is necessary to pattern-match with unfree data types.
    Because unfree data have many forms for same data, so there are multiple ways of destruction.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Non-linear patterns</dt>
  <dd>
    Bindings in a pattern can be refer in the same pattern.
    It is necessary to write useful patterns for pattern-matching with multiple results.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Patterns have lexical scoping</dt>
  <dd>
    We can modularize usefule patterns with <i>pattern-functions</i>, functions that receive patterns and return a pattern.
    Since a pattern-function has lexical scoping, bindings for pattern-variables in the argument patterns and the body of pattern-functions don't conflict.
    Useful patterns can be reused in many places in a program without worry of name clash.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Egison's pattern-matching is going to include a following feature.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Auto-parallelized pattern-matching</dt>
  <dd>
    Parallelizable loops are expressed with a single pattern-matching expression in Egison.
    Pattern-matching process inside Egison itself can be parallelized easily.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Algorithms are expressed <b>intuitively</b> and will be <b>auto-parallelized</b> with Egison!!
